Hello, my name is Hugo Hendrix and I am a passionate student of Digital Marketing and Front-end Development. Currently, I am dedicated to studying English and programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS. Soon, I will be graduating in Digital Marketing Technology.

My goal is to help people open their own businesses and achieve success in the digital age. I am also a proud pet parent of four dogs and a cat, and I am fortunate to share my life with LetÃ­cia, my wife and partner in everything since 2012.

Over the past 8 years, I have worked at Trans Sat Gerenciamento de Risco as a monitoring operator for trucks carrying high-risk loads, using the SASCAR Sasgc software. Additionally, I have developed skills in training and qualifying new employees, creating routes, goals, and strategies for automation in secure locations for vehicles.

I am excited to continue developing my skills and contributing to the growth of companies and individuals looking for innovative and efficient solutions in the area of Digital Marketing and Front-end Development.
