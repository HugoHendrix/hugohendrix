Hello! My name is Hugo Hendrix, and I am a graduate of Digital Marketing Technology and passionate about Front-end Development. Currently, I am dedicated to studying English and honing my skills in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS.

I aim to help people boost their businesses and succeed in the digital era.

Over the past 8 years, I have had an enriching journey in the field of risk management, working as a truck monitoring operator with high-risk cargo for theft, using the Sasgc software from SASCAR. I have also developed skills in training and qualifying new colleagues, and creating routes, goals, and strategies for automation in secure locations for vehicles.

I am excited to continue growing professionally and making even more contributions to the development of companies and individuals, offering innovative and efficient solutions in the Digital Marketing and Front-end Development field.

Together, we can go further! Let's keep evolving and reaching new horizons in the digital world! ðŸš€ðŸ’¼ #DigitalMarketing #FrontEndDevelopment #ProfessionalGrowth #Innovation #LinkedinLearning
